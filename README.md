A deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues


Taken from "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart

I have some descriptions and comments about the process. I liked the "whiles" logic too.

And according to the book, I have new activities for this game:
- language select (PT-BR actual, EN-US future)
- Score based in conclusion time and challenges
- More difficult options
